The Network Infrastructure folder will showcase projects and exercises that demonstrate my understanding of network design, implementation, and security. This includes both academic assignments and hands-on labs that highlight my ability to analyze and manage network environments. Key elements in this folder will include network topology diagrams, illustrating how devices, servers, and clients are interconnected to support communication and data flow efficiently. I will include documentation of network configurations, demonstrating my experience with IP addressing, routing, switching, and subnetting, as well as troubleshooting common network issues.

Additionally, this folder will feature projects focused on network security, such as identifying vulnerabilities, implementing access controls, and monitoring traffic to detect potential threats. Each project will include a clear explanation of the tools and techniques used, the steps taken to configure or analyze the network, and the outcomes achieved. Screenshots, diagrams, and summaries of lab exercises will provide visual context and highlight my hands-on experience. Overall, the Network Infrastructure folder reflects my ability to design, maintain, and secure networks, illustrating both technical proficiency and practical problem-solving skills that are essential for a career in cybersecurity and IT.
