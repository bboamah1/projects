# projects
I will showcase academic projects based on my coursework in database management, system administration, network infrastructure, and cybersecurity. These projects demonstrate my ability to configure systems, manage data, analyze network designs, identify vulnerabilities, and apply security principles to real-world technical scenarios.

My project portfolio showcases a range of academic and hands-on projects developed through my coursework in cybersecurity at the University of Cincinnati. These projects reflect my experience across database management, system administration, network infrastructure, and information security, highlighting both my technical skills and my ability to apply theory to real-world scenarios.

Within database-focused projects, I have worked on designing, managing, and querying relational databases to support secure data storage and efficient information retrieval. These projects demonstrate my understanding of data integrity, access controls, and the importance of protecting sensitive information within structured systems. I emphasize proper documentation, organization, and security considerations throughout each stage of database development.

My system administration projects showcase experience with configuring and maintaining operating systems, managing user permissions, and implementing basic security controls. These projects highlight my ability to understand how systems operate at a foundational level, troubleshoot issues, and apply best practices to ensure system reliability and security. I also focus on system hardening concepts and the role administrators play in maintaining a secure computing environment.

In network infrastructure projects, I demonstrate an understanding of how networks are designed, implemented, and secured. These projects include working with network topologies, analyzing traffic flow, and identifying potential vulnerabilities within network environments. I showcase my ability to think critically about network performance, availability, and security from an enterprise perspective.

Additionally, my cybersecurity-focused projects highlight skills in risk assessment, vulnerability analysis, and incident response concepts. These projects demonstrate how I approach identifying threats, evaluating risks, and proposing mitigation strategies. Overall, my portfolio reflects my growth as a cybersecurity student, my attention to detail, and my readiness to apply these skills in professional co-op or internship environments while continuing to learn and adapt in a rapidly evolving field.
